            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Relation of what passed at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> in <hi>August</hi> last, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the evill carriage of the <hi>Sultan Hibraim,</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had of long time alienated from him the hearts of the most parts of his Subjects, and chiefly of his Militia, not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to endure: So their discontents being come to a greater height by extraordinary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, this Militia resolved to free themselves from them, by making away the first <hi>Vizier,</hi> and by deposing of the grand <hi>Seigniour</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>And to the same intent they gathered together on Friday the 7th of <hi>August</hi> last hard by the <hi>Mosky</hi> of <hi>Sultan Mehemet,</hi> and sent for the <hi>Mophty,</hi> together with the <hi>Cadileskiers;</hi> one of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> the other of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Lawyers.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Seigniour</hi> having warning of what passed, sent some to speake in his name to the souldiers and their Officers, to desire them to disperse quietly, with promises they should receive full satisfaction. He did send also to the <hi>Mophty,</hi> to entreate him to quiet the mutiny: But the Militia answered, That they were gathered to remedy many things which they found to be amisse in the Government: And the <hi>Mophty</hi> said, that being sent for by the Militia, he had been forced to obey them; That he would doe his best endeavour to hinder disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but that he was forced to declare to the Grand <hi>Seigniour,</hi> that the Militia would not suffer <hi>Acemet Basha,</hi> the Great <hi>Vizier,</hi> to enjoy his place any longer, and desired the same office to be bestowed upon <hi>Mehemet Basha,</hi> who was an old man of seventy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162440:3"/>yeares of age, retired from the world, and from all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>The same answer being brought by the Grand <hi>Seigniour,</hi> he sent presently word to the <hi>Mophty,</hi> that he was well pleased to make the said <hi>Mehemet Basha</hi> Great <hi>Vizier,</hi> and thereupon that old man was sent to his Highnesse, who spake to him roughly, asking him who had sent him, and objecting that he was not capable of that employment, and notwithstanding gave him the <hi>Bull,</hi> which is the chiefe token of that dignity.</p>
            <p>There was nothing more done that day, except that the old <hi>Vizier,</hi> who had fled from his owne house to that of one of his kindred, resolved upon the evening of the same day, to go and cast himselfe to the mercy of the new <hi>Vizier,</hi> as well because he thought him to be one of his friends, as thinking by that fained confidence to engage him to shew him some mercy, and save his life: But the Militia hearing from the said new <hi>Vizier,</hi> that he had the accursed man in his owne power; sent some souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to tell him, that he should make him away; and so he was strangled at that time, and his body exposed in the great place of the new <hi>Mosky,</hi> which is not farre from the <hi>Serralia</hi> of the Grand <hi>Seigniour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day about eight of the clock in the morning, the Militia gathered in the said great place, to the number often or twelve thousands; the <hi>Janizaries</hi> being armed with swords and guns, and the <hi>Spatries</hi> with swords only. The chiefest of them, and the Officers went into the <hi>Mosky,</hi> where also came presently after the <hi>Mophty Napguiq,</hi> who is the chiefe of those, who are said to be descended from the pretended Prophet, MAHOMET, The <hi>Cadileskyers</hi> and other Lawyers: Amongst whom one of the <hi>Cadileskyers,</hi> who is he of <hi>Romelye,</hi> presuming to get into the <hi>Mosky,</hi> as the others after the <hi>Mophty,</hi> the said <hi>Mophty</hi> turning himselfe backe had scarce ended these words, <hi>This is none of ours,</hi> that being heard by some of the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:162440:3"/>they fell instantly upon that <hi>Cadileskyer,</hi> and hackt him all into pieces: which gave occasion to some to believe, that this conspiration was fore-thought of, and agreed upon by some of the chiefest, and not only contrived by the Militia.</p>
            <p>This execution having nothing slackened the first designe, being met together in the <hi>Mosky,</hi> an Officer of the <hi>Spatries</hi> spake first, and said to the <hi>Mophty,</hi> that the Militia was come there together to complain against the Grand <hi>Seigniour,</hi> and to remedy the present abuses.</p>
            <p>To which the <hi>Mophty</hi> answered, that it was fit to hear what the Grand <hi>Seigniour</hi> would say in his owne defence. Therefore they sent for him to appeare before the justice of God, and to answer to the complaints of the Militia: That word of justice of God being an epithet which the Turks give to their Law, called, <hi>Cher-alla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mophty Nupguiq</hi> was then deputed with two Lawyers to bring him that word: But his Highnesse having heard them, gave answer, that he would not goe to justice; and if they had any thing to complaine of against him, they should come to him; that he would hear his Militia, and give them satisfaction.</p>
            <p>That answer being brought to the Assembly and the <hi>Moph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> being consulted, said, that to omit nothing of the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they should make a <hi>Fetfu,</hi> (which is a kind of judgement which the <hi>Mophty</hi> pronounceth, when he is consulted about any businesse) by which it should be asserted, that any one who is called before the justice of God, is bound to appeare there; and that the Grand <hi>Seigniour</hi> himself is not free from that Law. The <hi>Fitfu</hi> was presently made, and instead of sending any Lawyers to denounce it, as it was done by the former deliberation, they did choose a <hi>Spatry</hi> and a <hi>Janizary</hi> of the most ancient that were in their places, but of no g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at concernment.</p>
            <p>Those two rid upon horses, one of them holding the <hi>Fetfu</hi> very high, that the Militia might see it; and came
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162440:4"/>to the Grand <hi>Seigniour,</hi> to whom they delivered their writing; which his Highnesse having read, he tore it in pieces, adding, That he would never goe before the Justice; that they should doe their utmost, he was not afraid of any thing: But if his Militia would depute some Officers to speake with him, they should have audience.</p>
            <p>The two Souldiers having acquainted the Assembly with that answer, the <hi>Mophty</hi> was urged to declare what a man doth deserve, who will not obey justice; and said, that any one which doth not obey the justice of God, is no true <hi>Musulman;</hi> his wife is no more his wife; and if he is an Emperour, hee doth forfeit his Office, and the right he had to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Mophty</hi> made presently a second <hi>Fetfu</hi> of this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and the same two Souldiers were sent with it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it to the Grand <hi>Seigniour,</hi> who after the reading of it, did with it as before, tearing it, with threatnings, that he would one day avenge himselfe of those factious men: Which words being related, the <hi>Mophty,</hi> the Lawyers and Officers of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia did resolve to goe themselves to the <hi>Seralia,</hi> and declare to the Grand <hi>Seigniour,</hi> that he was no more Emperour, and to take the eldest of his children, called <hi>Sultan Mehemet,</hi> set him upon his Throne, and proclaime him Emperour. They went then from the <hi>Moskey</hi> about five a clocke in the evening, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spatris,</hi> came to the <hi>Seralia,</hi> at the Gate leading to the Grand <hi>Seigniours</hi> lodging: And it is said, that then his Highnesse, who was resolved to shew himselfe to them, and to reprove them roughly, seeing so great a number of Souldiers, fainted in his heart, and intreated to <hi>Valida,</hi> that is to say, the Mother <hi>Sultane,</hi> to helpe him out of that danger, endeavouring to quiet the mutiny: She promised him to doe her best, and having perswa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d him to withdraw into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, she lockt him in, and tooke the key with her, and went to the <hi>Mophty</hi> and the Officers of the Militia, to enquire why they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162440:4"/>came in that manner to the <hi>Seralia</hi> with armed men, contrary to the respect and honour due to the Gate of the Grand <hi>Seigniour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mophty</hi> advancing towards her, told her, that the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia having great complaints to make against <hi>Sultan Hibraim,</hi> had called him before the Justice; the which having not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had made himselfe unworthy of the Crowne, and that the Militia would have the <hi>Sultan Mehemet</hi> delivered to them, to proclaime him Emperour. The Princesse endeavoured to perswade him, that they had no ground to take away the Crowne from her Sonne; and that if there had been any thing amisse in the Government, it was done by the <hi>Vizier,</hi> who had abused his Masters authority, and that he had beene justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for it, entreating them that they would proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but leave her Sonne in his Throne, promising, that all the abuses should be reformed, and if her Sonne had before that time failed in any thing, he would mend for the future.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mophty</hi> answered, that all those excuses were needlesse, and declared that the businesse was fully resolved; and if the <hi>Sultan Mehemet</hi> was not sent presently to him, they would fetch him by force out of the <hi>Seralia:</hi> which forced at last the said Princesse to bring out the young Prince, and present him before the Assembly.</p>
            <p>It was presently commanded that the Imperiall Seat should be brought, with a <hi>Turban</hi> trimmed, with some hens fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is instead of a Crowne amongst the <hi>Ottomans</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; Afterward the young Prince (being but seven years of age) was set upon the Throne, and the Imperiall <hi>Turban</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, and so was proclaimed Emperour.</p>
            <p>The whole Militia being in the Courts of the <hi>Seralia,</hi> and there-about, cryed presently, GOD SAVE SVL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAN MEHEMET: Which being done, every one went home; And the 9th of the said month <hi>August</hi> last,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162440:5"/>the conclusion of the businesse was, That the New <hi>Vizier,</hi> and the Officers of the Militia, with a great number of <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spatris</hi> came backe againe to the <hi>Seralia,</hi> where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the unhappy <hi>Sultan Hibraim</hi> to a chamber; which is the same prison where he hath been kept many years in the Reign of <hi>Sultan Amurat;</hi> and they charged the <hi>Boustangy Bachy,</hi> who hath the guard of the <hi>Seralia,</hi> and doth command to all the <hi>Boustangis,</hi> with the keeping of his person there.</p>
